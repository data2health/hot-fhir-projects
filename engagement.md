# Welcome to Health Open Terminologies(HOT)

Thanks for being interested in contributing to our efforts to coordinate the community to work towards a more interoperable, rich, accessible, and domain-addressing landscape of clinical terminologies.

We are looking for community participation in the following areas:
- Efforts to define requirements for terminological interoperability
- Extension of terminological standards for representation
- Extension of the FHIR terminology specification and delivery of terminologies via FHIR servers
- Building a catalog of FHIR implementations
- Testing and evaluation of terminological applications

If you donâ€™t see exactly what you want to be doing or think we should be doing, please make a ticket or contact us on Slack.
 
If you are interested in participating, please [onboard here](http://bit.ly/cd2h-onboarding-form)

You can find us on the #hot-fhir channel on the [CD2H Slack](https://cd2h.slack.com/messages/CGCAPAANA)
